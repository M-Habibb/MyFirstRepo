Hello, my name is Mohammed. I am a student currently exploring the world of technology and development. I'm particularly interested in areas like data analysis, software engineering, and educational technology.

This is my first hands-on experience with GitHub and version control. Iâ€™m eager to learn more and grow in this space, and this repository marks the beginning of that journey.
